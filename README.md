This repository will contain the presentation and python jupyter notebooks for my DataHack Summit 2025 conference talk, Building Effective Agentic AI Systems: Lessons from the Field. Drawing from my experience building deploying Agentic AI systems, we’ll focus on three pillars: Architecting, Optimizing, and Observability for Agentic AI Systems.

# Session Details

---

Everyone is building AI agents, but how do you design **Agentic AI Systems** that are truly reliable in the real world?

Agentic AI systems can **plan tasks, use tools, reflect on results, and even collaborate** with other agents.  
But building them at scale brings challenges:

- ⚙️ Choosing the right agent architecture  
- 🧠 Handling memory & context efficiently  
- ⚡ Reducing latency  
- 📊 Monitoring and evaluating agents effectively  

This session draws from my personal experience building and deploying Agentic AI systems over the past year.  
We’ll focus on three pillars: **Architecting, Optimizing, and Observability** for Agentic AI Systems.
