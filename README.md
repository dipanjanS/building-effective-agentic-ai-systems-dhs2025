# building-effective-agentic-ai-systems-dhs2025
This repository will contain the presentation and python jupyter notebooks for my DataHack Summit 2025 conference talk, Building Effective Agentic AI Systems: Lessons from the Field. Drawing from my experience building deploying Agentic AI systems, weâ€™ll focus on three pillars: Architecting, Optimizing, and Observability for Agentic AI Systems.
